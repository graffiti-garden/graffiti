# @graffiti-garden/wrapper-runtime-types

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f48eb26: Accept `{ session }` options in `get`, `getMedia`, `discover`, `continueDiscover`,
  and synchronization helpers. Vue read composables accept options with reactive fields,
  with `autopoll` moved into the discovery options. Legacy positional sessions (identified
  by a top-level `actor`) and the fourth Vue autopoll argument remain supported.
  
  Update implementations and deployed RPC/data-guard hosts before switching callers
  to the options form. Existing callers can keep using positional sessions throughout
  that rollout. The shared `normalizeGraffitiReadOptions` API utility handles both
  forms. Renderless Vue component props and caching behavior are unchanged.
- Updated dependencies [f48eb26]
