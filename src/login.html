    </h1>

    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://graffiti.garden"> Graffiti</a> is a
        system that connects different social media applications so that you can
        seamlessly migrate between them without losing your data or
        relationships. With a little bit of web programming, you can also modify
        existing Graffiti applications or create your own.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data on Graffiti is not hosted on a central server, so to get started
        you need to connect a storage provider. At the momment, Graffiti only
        supports Dropbox, however we are working on adding support for other
        storage providers like Google Drive and protocols like Solid.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that all your data is encrypted so that regardless of which storage
        provider you choose, they won't be able to read your data.

    <h1>Graffiti Actors</h1>
    <p>
        Now that you have connected a storage provider, you need to select an
        "actor". An actor is a unique identity kind of like an "account" on
        other social platforms. However, an actor is not tied to any one
        platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can create as many actors as you like. Your actors are stored
        locally in your browser for your privacy. You can use them across
        different Graffiti apps within your browser, or you can export them to
        use in other browsers or on other devices.
